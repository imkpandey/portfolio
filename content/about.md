# About Me
---
Welcome to my portfolio. Here's what you need you to know...
### Interests
I like to think of me as a Jack of all trades. I love getting my hands dirty with code and am always yearning to know more about computers. I am experienced in Python, C++ and some of Flutter. I am a bit inclined towards Machine Learning and to experience AI in modern gizmos is a serious turn on for me. OpenSource Contribution and taming Python is what i do. Sniffing Paperbacks is my guilty pleasure.
### Current
